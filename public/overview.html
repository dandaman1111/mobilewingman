						Mobile Wingman allows users to tag friends on their mobile phone.  The application the saves the friend's facial structure so that the application can automatically recognize and display that friend's information from their social networks.</p>
	
				<p>  This application is great for a person who has trouble recognizing friends they don't see very often.  An example case is that a user could get used to tagging all of their facebook friends with this application and the next time they are in a situation where they cannot put a finger on who a person is, they could use mobile wingman to scan the faces and display a screen with a variety of information such as their name, age, relationship status, and other personal information.  If a user is still confused, they can click on the user to gain information on their networks, likes, education, past relationships, favorites, recent statuses, recent tweets and much more.</p>
				<h12>How it Works:</h12>
				<ul>
					<li>Tag a Friend</li>
						<p>When you go into tag mode, Mobile Wingman will detect a face and allow you to choose which of your facebook friends it corresponds to, then it will take that face and break it down into an eigen-face (a mathematical representation of a face).  It will then save this connection into your phone.</p>
					<li>Scan a Room</li>
						<p>When you are in scan mode, your phone's camera will scan its surroundings.  When ever it spot faces it will similarly convert those faces into eigen-faces and compare this eigen-face against the others stored in the phone.  If there is a match, it will add their name, age and relationship status to the preview screen above their face all in a color coded system that is based on matchability.</p>
					<li>Get More Info</li>
						<p>Once a friend has been recognized, they can be clicked on to get more information about them.  This page will give all of the information about them that we can get from facebook and twitter.  This is great if you can't remember where they went to school, their favorite music/movies, their most recent posts, and other information that will help you stay on top of your game.</p>
				</ul>
