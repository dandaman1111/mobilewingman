An application developed by Daniel Sauerbrun, Thomas Kaehler, and Ryan Pakbaz for a mobile development class at UCSB.

The application would use facial recognition software written in C++ through android's NDK to compare a person's face
in a camera preview to a database of facial features on the application and return that person's name.
